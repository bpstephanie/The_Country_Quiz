All the code has been run through the [W3C html Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and the [JSHint JavaScript Validator](https://jshint.com/). Minor errors were found in the JavaScript code, such as missing semicolons and unnecessary semicolons. After a fix and retest, no errors were returned for all  three.
